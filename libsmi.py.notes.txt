Change a baked-in default in OpenSesame's SMI library from "expects a single IP address" to "expects 2 IP addresses". 

The source code lives at https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyGaze/blob/master/pygaze/_eyetracker/libsmi.py

The path to installed libsmi.py is .../site-packages/pygaze/_eyetracker/libsmi.py
