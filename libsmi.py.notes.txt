Change a baked-in default in OpenSesame's SMI library from "expects a single IP address" to "expects 2 IP addresses". 

The path to libsmi.py is .../site-packages/pygaze/_eyetracker/libsmi.py

See lines 208/9 for two IP address setup. Remember to change the default variable "ip"'s instantiation value too in __init__ just in case that mattered.

Other changes done in Feb 2020: allow an .idf file to be written (line 167-ish in "output file properties"))
