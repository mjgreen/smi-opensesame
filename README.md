How to set up the SMI RED in P103i to use opensesame as the stimulus program running on a separate PC

# Display settings for OpenSesame use
The laptop needs to be set up as follows: right click on the desktop and choose "Screen resolution". From "screen resolution" choose "display on 1 only" - this means that the laptop is constrained to show things only on its own inbuilt screen.

The stimulus PC needs to be set up as follows: right click on the desktop and choose "Screen resolution". From "screen resolution" choose "display on 1 only" - this constrains the stimulus PC to show things only on its screen 1 which is the SMI  screen to which the stimulus PC must be attached using the (blue) VGA connection.

# Display settings for Experimnt Center use
Firstly, there is a difference between Windows's screen numbering, which uses number 1 for whichever screen is set to be the primary screen and can be either the laptop's inbuilt screen, or the SMI display; and Experiment Center's screen numbering (which is also named either 1 or 2, but is relative to whichever Windows screen is set to be the primary). For example, if Windows's primary screen (which becomes screen 1) is set to be the SMI, then Experiment Center's screen 1 will be the SMI. If Windows's primary screen (which becomes screen 1) is set to be the laptop, then Experiment Center's screen 1 will be the laptop.

To revert the screen settings to the room's default, do the following: from the laptop right click the desktop and choose "screen resolution". From "screen resolution" choose "extend this display". Then click on the picture of the SMI screen and choose "use this display as primary". Then Experiment Center projects (which at BU typically assume that the SMI is Windows's primary screen rather than that the inbuilt laptop is Windows' primary screen) will use the SMI screen as screen 1.

If you find that the screen settings seem to be wrong for your particular Experiment Center project (i.e., that the calibration appears on the laptop) then you have two ways to fix it. Way 1 is to toggle 1 and 2 on the bottom bar of the Experiment Center interface. Way 2 is to change Windows's primary screen to be 'the other one' - i.e., whichever screen it is not currently set to that makes you think the display settings are wrong.
